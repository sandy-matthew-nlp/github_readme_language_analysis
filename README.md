# Natural Language Processing Analysis on Github Repositories: Can We Predict What Language a Repository Utilizes Based on the Wording of the Readme File Associated With It?

## A project by Sandy Graham and Matthew Capper

### Notebook NLP_Final_Draft in this repository presents a clean Notebook presenting the steps taken in this experiement.  Popular github repositories were scraped, and the primary programming language from the header is taken as an association for classification, along with the readme text from each repository. Cursory cleaning/trimming is done from a prepare.py file, and exploration and modeling is taken from that point forward.
