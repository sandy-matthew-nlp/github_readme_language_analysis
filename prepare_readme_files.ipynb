      "Terminal & Console Overview\n",
      "Please take a few minutes to review the overview below before diving into the code:\n",
      "Windows Terminal\n",
      "Windows Terminal is a new, modern, feature-rich, productive terminal application for command-line users. It includes many of the features most frequently requested by the Windows command-line community including support for tabs, rich text, globalization, configurability, theming & styling, and more.\n",
      "The Terminal will also need to meet our goals and measures to ensure it remains fast, and efficient, and doesn't consume vast amounts of memory or power.\n",
      "The Windows console host\n",
      "The Windows console host, conhost.exe, is Windows' original command-line user experience. It implements Windows' command-line infrastructure, and is responsible for hosting the Windows Console API, input engine, rendering engine, and user preferences. The console host code in this repository is the actual source from which the conhost.exe in Windows itself is built.\n",
      "Console's primary goal is to remain backwards-compatible with existing console subsystem applications.\n",
      "Since assuming ownership of the Windows command-line in 2014, the team has added several new features to the Console, including window transparency, line-based selection, support for ANSI / Virtual Terminal sequences, 24-bit color, a Pseudoconsole (\"ConPTY\"), and more.\n",
      "However, because the Console's primary goal is to maintain backward compatibility, we've been unable to add many of the features the community has been asking for, and which we've been wanting to add for the last several years--like tabs!\n",
      "These limitations led us to create the new Windows Terminal.\n",
      "Shared Components\n",
      "While overhauling the Console, we've modernized its codebase considerably. We've cleanly separated logical entities into modules and classes, introduced some key extensibility points, replaced several old, home-grown collections and containers with safer, more efficient STL containers, and made the code simpler and safer by using Microsoft's WIL header library.\n",
      "This overhaul work resulted in the creation of several key components that would be useful for any terminal implementation on Windows, including a new DirectWrite-based text layout and rendering engine, a text buffer capable of storing both UTF-16 and UTF-8, and a VT parser/emitter.\n",
      "Building a new terminal\n",
      "When we started building the new terminal application, we explored and evaluated several approaches and technology stacks. We ultimately decided that our goals would be best met by sticking with C++ and sharing the aforementioned modernized components, placing them atop the modern Windows application platform and UI framework.\n",
      "Further, we realized that this would allow us to build the terminal's renderer and input stack as a reusable Windows UI control that others can incorporate into their applications.\n",
      "FAQ\n",
      "Where can I download Windows Terminal?\n",
      "There are no binaries to download quite yet.\n",
      "The Windows Terminal is in the very early alpha stage, and not ready for the general public quite yet. If you want to jump in early, you can try building it yourself from source.\n",
      "Otherwise, you'll need to wait until Mid-June for an official preview build to drop.\n",
      "I built and ran the new Terminal, but it looks just like the old console! What gives?\n",
      "Firstly, make sure you're building & deploying CascadiaPackage in Visual Studio, NOT Host.EXE. OpenConsole.exe is just conhost.exe, the same old console you know and love. opencon.cmd will launch openconsole.exe, and unfortunately, openterm.cmd is currently broken.\n",
      "Secondly, try pressing Ctrl+t. The tabs are hidden when you only have one tab by default. In the future, the UI will be dramatically different, but for now, the defaults are supposed to look like the console defaults.\n",
      "I tried running WindowsTerminal.exe and it crashes!\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't try to run it unpackaged. Make sure to build & deploy CascadiaPackage from Visual Studio, and run the Windows Terminal (Preview) app.\n",
      "Make sure you're on the right version of Windows. You'll need to be on Insider's builds, or wait for the 1903 release, as the Windows Terminal REQUIRES features from the latest Windows release.\n",
      "\n",
      "Getting Started\n",
      "Prerequisites\n",
      "\n",
      "You must be running Windows 1903 (build >= 10.0.18362.0) or above in order to run Windows Terminal\n",
      "You must have the 1903 SDK (build 10.0.18362.0) installed\n",
      "You will need at least VS 2017 installed\n",
      "You will need to install both the following packages in VS (\"Workloads\" tab in Visual Studio Installer) :\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Desktop Development with C++\"\n",
      "\"Universal Windows Platform Development\"\n",
      "If you're running VS2019, you'll also need to install the \"v141 Toolset\" and \"Visual C++ ATL for x86 and x64\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You will also need to enable Developer Mode in the Settings app to enable installing the Terminal app for running locally.\n",
      "\n",
      "Contributing\n",
      "We are excited to work alongside you, our amazing community, to build and enhance Windows Terminal!\n",
      "We ask that before you start work on a feature that you would like to contribute, please file an issue describing your proposed change: We will be happy to work with you to figure out the best approach, provide guidance and mentorship throughout feature development, and help avoid any wasted or duplicate effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "👉 Remember! Your contributions may be incorporated into future versions of Windows! Because of this, all pull requests will be subject to the same level of scrutiny for quality, coding standards, performance, globalization, accessibility, and compatibility as those of our internal contributors.\n",

      "\n",
      "⚠ Note: The Command-Line Team is actively working out of this repository and will be periodically re-structuring the code to make it easier to comprehend, navigate, build, test, and contribute to, so DO expect significant changes to code layout on a regular basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Communicating with the Team\n",
      "The easiest way to communicate with the team is via GitHub issues. Please file new issues, feature requests and suggestions, but DO search for similar open/closed pre-existing issues before you do.\n",

consume the windows console apis build status project build status terminal colortool terminal console overview please take a few minutes to review the overview below before diving into the code windows terminal windows terminal is a new modern feature rich productive terminal application for command line users it includes many of the features most frequently requested by the windows command line community including support for tabs rich text globalization configurability theming styling and more the terminal will also need to meet our goals and measures to ensure it remains fast and efficient and doesn t consume vast amounts of memory or power the windows console host the windows console host conhost exe is windows original command line user experience it implements windows command line infrastructure and is responsible for hosting the windows console api input engine rendering engine and user preferences the console host code in this repository is the actual source from which the conhost exe in windows itself is built console s primary goal is to remain backwards compatible with existing console subsystem applications since assuming ownership of the windows command line in 2014 the team has added several new features to the console including window transparency line based selection support for ansi virtual terminal sequences 24 bit color a pseudoconsole conpty and more however because the console s primary goal is to maintain backward compatibility we ve been unable to add many of the features the community has been asking for and which we ve been wanting to add for the last several years like tabs these limitations led us to create the new windows terminal shared components while overhauling the console we ve modernized its codebase considerably we ve cleanly separated logical entities into modules and classes introduced some key extensibility points replaced several old home grown collections and containers with safer more efficient stl containers and made the code simpler and safer by using microsoft s wil header library this overhaul work resulted in the creation of several key components that would be useful for any terminal implementation on windows including a new directwrite based text layout and rendering engine a text buffer capable of storing both utf 16 and utf 8 and a vt parser emitter building a new terminal when we started building the new terminal application we explored and evaluated several approaches and technology stacks we ultimately decided that our goals would be best met by sticking with c and sharing the aforementioned modernized components placing them atop the modern windows application platform and ui framework further we realized that this would allow us to build the terminal s renderer and input stack as a reusable windows ui control that others can incorporate into their applications faq where can i download windows terminal there are no binaries to download quite yet the windows terminal is in the very early alpha stage and not ready for the general public quite yet if you want to jump in early you can try building it yourself from source otherwise you ll need to wait until mid june for an official preview build to drop i built and ran the new terminal but it looks just like the old console what gives firstly make sure you re building deploying cascadiapackage in visual studio not host exe openconsole exe is just conhost exe the same old console you know and love opencon cmd will launch openconsole exe and unfortunately openterm cmd is currently broken secondly try pressing ctrl t the tabs are hidden when you only have one tab by default in the future the ui will be dramatically different but for now the defaults are supposed to look like the console defaults i tried running windowsterminal exe and it crashes don t try to run it unpackaged make sure to build deploy cascadiapackage from visual studio and run the windows terminal preview app make sure you re on the right version of windows you ll need to be on insider s builds or wait for the 1903 release as the windows terminal requires features from the latest windows release getting started prerequisites you must be running windows 1903 build 10 0 18362 0 or above in order to run windows terminal you must have the 1903 sdk build 10 0 18362 0 installed you will need at least vs 2017 installed you will need to install both the following packages in vs workloads tab in visual studio installer desktop development with c universal windows platform development if you re running vs2019 you ll also need to install the v141 toolset and visual c atl for x86 and x64 you will also need to enable developer mode in the settings app to enable installing the terminal app for running locally contributing we are excited to work alongside you our amazing community to build and enhance windows terminal we ask that before you start work on a feature that you would like to contribute please file an issue describing your proposed change we will be happy to work with you to figure out the best approach provide guidance and mentorship throughout feature development and help avoid any wasted or duplicate

performance globalization accessibility and compatibility as those of our internal contributors note the command line team is actively working out of this repository and will be periodically re structuring the code to make it easier to comprehend navigate build test and contribute to so do expect significant changes to code layout on a regular basis communicating with the team the easiest

      "CSS-Only Chat\n",
      "A truly monstrous async web chat using no JS whatsoever on the frontend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait what\n",
      "This is an asynchronous chat that sends + receives messages in the browser with no reloads and no javascript.\n",
      "Ok so how\n",
      "Background-images loaded via pseudoselectors + a forever-loading index page (remember Comet?).\n",
      "Say that again?\n",
      "Ok, so there are two things we need the browser to do: send data and receive data.  Let's start with the first.\n",
      "Sending Data\n",
      "CSS is really limited in what it can do.  However, we can use it to effectively detect button presses:\n",
      ".some-button:active {\n",
      "  background-image: url('some_image.jpg')\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "What's cool is that a browser won't actually load that background image until this selector is used - that is, when this button is pressed.  So now we have a way to trigger a request to a server of our choice on a button press.  That sounds like data sending!\n",
      "Now, of course, this only works once per button (since a browser won't try to load that image twice), but it's a start.\n",
      "Receiving Data\n",
      "Since we can't use JS, it's really hard to change a page after it's already been loaded.  But it is possible.\n",
      "Back before websockets were widely supported, we had to use clever hacks if we wanted to push data from a server to a client in an ongoing basis.  One such hack was just to make the page never finish loading.  It turns out that you can tell the browser to start rendering a page before it's finished loading (using the Transfer-Encoding: chunked http header).  And when you do that, you don't actually have to stop loading the page.  You can just keep adding stuff to the bottom of the html forever, at whatever rate you want.\n",
      "So, for example, you could start sending a normal html page, then just stop sending html (while still telling the client you're sending) until you're ready to deliver another message.\n",
      "Now, all this lets us do is periodically append html to the page.  What can we do with that?  How about, when you load the index page, this happens:\n",
      "\n",
      "We load up the first pile of html we want to show.  A welcome message, etc.\n",
      "We stop loading html for a while until we want to send some sort of update.\n",
      "Now we load up a <style> element that display: none's all the previous html\n",
      "Then we load up whatever new html we want to show\n",
      "Finally we wait until the next update we want to send and GOTO 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Single-use buttons?\n",
      "Ok, so we have that problem earlier where each button is only single-use.  It tries to send a get request once, then never will again.\n",
      "Thankfully, our method of receiving data fixes that for us.  Here's what happens:\n",
      "\n",
      "We show an \"a\" button whose background image is like \"img/a\".\n",
      "When you press it, the server receives the image request for \"a\"\n",
      "The server then pushes an update to the client to hide the current button and replace it with one whose background images is \"image/aa\".\n",
      "\n",
      "If the buttons you pressed were \"h\", \"e\", and \"l\", then the \"a\" button's background image url would be \"img/hela\".  And since we're replacing all buttons every time you press one, the single-use button problem goes away!\n",
      "Misc other details\n",
      "\n",
      "We actually encode a bit more info into the button urls (like each client's id)\n",
      "Because the data-sending and data-receiving happens on different threads, we need inter-thread communication.  That sounds like work, so we'll just use Redis pubsub for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "FAQ\n",
      "What inspired this? Chernobyl, Hindenburg, The Tacoma Narrows Bridge...\n",
      "Really? No, it was this clever tweet by davywtf.\n",
      "Why's your code suck Why do you suck?\n",
      "No but really Because I was mostly making this up as I went.  There's a lot of exploratory coding here that I only minimally cleaned up.  If I rebuilt it I'd store the UI state for a client in redis and just push it out in its entirety when needed via a single generic screen-updating mechanism.\n",
      "What could go wrong with this technique? Broken by browser bg-image handling changes; long-request timeouts; running out of threads; fast-clicking bugs; generic concurrency headaches; poor handling by proxies; it's crazy inaccessible; etc etc\n",
      "Should I use this in real life? Dear god yes.\n",
      "I have an idea for how this could be made better/worse/hackier Tweet at me (@kkuchta).  I'm always down to see a terrible idea taken further!\n",

      "Welcome to the code repository for Flutter for web.\n",

      "support as a first-tier platform in the Flutter SDK alongside iOS and Android.\n",
      "The code in this repository is a stepping stone to that goal,\n",
      "providing web-only packages that implement (almost) the entire Flutter API.\n",
      "Web support for Flutter is not yet stable. We're designating this release as a\n",

      "meets developers' needs, iterate on major features and get to feature complete.\n",
      "Design and implementation may change significantly, and changes may be\n",

      "short introduction to Flutter for web\n",
      "on our blog.\n",
      "Important notes\n",
      "Limitations\n",
      "We intend to completely support all of Flutter's API and functionality across\n",
      "modern browsers. However, during this preview, there are a number of exceptions:\n",
      "\n",
      "flutter_web does not have a plugin system yet. Temporarily, we provide\n",
      "access to dart:html, dart:js, dart:svg, dart:indexed_db and other web\n",
      "libraries that give you access to the vast majority of browser APIs. However,\n",
      "expect that these libraries will be replaced by a different plugin API.\n",
      "Not all Flutter APIs are implemented on Flutter for web yet.\n",
      "Performance work is only just beginning. The code generated by Flutter for web\n",
      "may run slowly, or demonstrate significant UI \"jank\".\n",
      "At this time, desktop UI interactions are not fully complete, so a UI built\n",
      "with flutter_web may feel like a mobile app, even\n",
      "when running on a desktop browser.\n",
      "The development workflow is only designed to work with Chrome at the moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Browser support\n",
      "Flutter for web provides:\n",
      "\n",
      "a production JavaScript compiler\n",
      "that generates optimized, minified code for deployment\n",
      "a development JavaScript compiler,\n",
      "that offers incremental compilation and hot restart\n",
      "\n",
      "When built with the production compiler, Flutter supports Chromium-based\n",
      "browsers and Safari, both on desktop and mobile. We also aim to fully support\n",
      "Firefox and Edge as targeted platforms, but our own test coverage is still low\n",
      "on these browsers. Our intention is to support the current and the last two\n",
      "major releases. Feedback on rendering and performance issues on all of these\n",
      "browsers is appreciated.\n",
      "Internet Explorer support is not planned.\n",
      "The development compiler currently supports Chrome only.\n",
      "Testing Flutter for web\n",
      "While we are far from code complete, we're ready for you to start developing\n",
      "and experimenting with Flutter for web. We are building the product around a\n",
      "number of target scenarios,\n",
      "as described in our blog,\n",
      "and we'd appreciate your feedback on feature gaps or suitability for these\n",

      "Of particular interest to us is testing across a variety of operating systems\n",
      "used for development (Windows, Linux, Mac) and browsers used for deployment.\n",
      "Since we are developing this in a separate fork to the main Flutter repo, we are\n",

is not yet stable we re designating this release as a technical preview designed to validate that the product meets developers needs iterate on major features and get to feature complete design and implementation may change significantly and changes may be introduced that break compatibility with existing code as a result the flutter team do not recommend using code created with flutter for web in production at this time you can find a short introduction to flutter for web on our blog important notes limitations we intend to completely support all of flutter s api and functionality across modern browsers however during this preview there are a number of exceptions flutter_web does not have a plugin system yet temporarily we provide access to dart html dart js dart svg dart indexed_db and other web libraries that give you access to the vast majority of browser apis however expect that these libraries will be replaced by a different plugin api not all flutter apis are implemented on flutter for web yet performance work is only just beginning the code generated by flutter for web may run slowly or demonstrate significant ui jank at this time desktop ui interactions are not fully complete so a ui built with flutter_web may feel like a mobile app even when running on a desktop browser the development workflow is only designed to work with chrome at the moment browser support flutter for web provides a production javascript compiler that generates optimized minified code for deployment a development javascript compiler that offers incremental compilation and hot restart when built with the production compiler flutter supports chromium based browsers and safari both on desktop and mobile we also aim to fully support firefox and edge as targeted platforms but our own test coverage is still low on these browsers our intention is to support the current and the last two major releases feedback on rendering and performance issues on all of these browsers is appreciated internet explorer support is not planned the development compiler currently supports chrome only testing flutter for web while we are far from code complete we re ready for you to start developing and experimenting with flutter for web we are building the product around a number of target scenarios as described in our blog and we d appreciate your feedback on feature gaps or suitability for these scenarios as well as other scenarios for which you find flutter useful on the web in addition we d love to see repros that demonstrate crashes rendering fidelity issues or extreme performance issues we d also love general feedback on the quality of the release and the developer experience of particular interest to us is testing across a variety of operating systems used

Peterson in 1957. Interpolation search resembles the method by which people search a telephone directory for a name (the key value by which the book's entries are ordered): in each step the algorithm calculates where in the remaining search space the sought item might be, based on the key values at the bounds of the search space and the value of the sought key, usually via a linear interpolation. The key value actually found at this estimated position is then compared to the key value being sought. If it is not equal, then depending on the comparison, the remaining search space is reduced to the part before or after the estimated position. This method will only work if calculations on the size of differences between key values are sensible.\n",
      "By comparison, binary search always chooses the middle of the remaining search space, discarding one half or the other, depending on the comparison between the key found at the estimated position and the key sought — it does not require numerical values for the keys, just a total order on them. The remaining search space is reduced to the part before or after the estimated position. The linear search uses equality only as it compares elements one-by-one from the start, ignoring any sorting.\n",
      "On average the interpolation search makes about log(log(n)) comparisons (if the elements are uniformly distributed), where n is the number of elements to be searched. In the worst case (for instance where the numerical values of the keys increase exponentially) it can make up to O(n) comparisons.\n",

To find the exact position of the search key in the list a linear search is performed on the sublist L[(k-1)m, km].\n",
      "The optimal value of m is √n, where n is the length of the list L. Because both steps of the algorithm look at, at most, √n items the algorithm runs in O(√n) time. This is better than a linear search, but worse than a binary search. The advantage over the latter is that a jump search only needs to jump backwards once, while a binary can jump backwards up to log n times. This can be important if a jumping backwards takes significantly more time than jumping forward.\n",
      "The algorithm can be modified by performing multiple levels of jump search on the sublists, before finally performing the linear search.

Local search procedures often become stuck in poor-scoring areas or areas where scores plateau. In order to avoid these pitfalls and explore regions of the search space that would be left unexplored by other local search procedures, tabu search carefully explores the neighborhood of each solution as the search progresses. The solutions admitted to the new neighborhood, {\\displaystyle N^{}(x)} N^(x), are determined through the use of memory structures. Using these memory structures, the search progresses by iteratively moving from the current solution {\\displaystyle x} x to an improved solution {\\displaystyle x'} x' in {\\displaystyle N^{}(x)} N^(x).\n",

More commonly, a tabu list consists of solutions that have changed by the process of moving from one solution to another.

caesar shift is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques it is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet for example with a left shift of 3 d would be replaced by a e would become b and so on the method is named after julius caesar who used it in his private correspondence the encryption step performed by a caesar cipher is often incorporated as part of more complex schemes such as the vigenere cipher and still has modern application in the rot13 system as with all single alphabet substitution ciphers the caesar cipher is easily broken and in modern practice offers essentially no communication security source wikipedia vigenere vigenere cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword it is a form of polyalphabetic substitution the vigenere cipher has been reinvented many times the

century and is now widely known as the vigenere cipher though the cipher is easy to understand and implement for three centuries it resisted all attempts to break it this earned it the description le

standard library sorting algorithms bubble sort bubble sort sometimes referred to as sinking sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order the pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed which indicates that the list is sorted properties worst case

the elements of an array into a number of buckets each bucket is then sorted individually either using a different sorting algorithm or by recursively applying the bucket sorting algorithm properties

shaker sort which can also refer to a variant of selection sort ripple sort shuffle sort or shuttle sort is a variation of bubble sort that is both a stable sorting algorithm and a comparison sort the algorithm differs from a bubble sort in that it sorts in both directions on each pass through the list properties worst case performance o n2 best case performance o n average case performance o n2

algorithms such as quicksort heapsort or merge sort properties worst case performance o n2 best case performance o n average case performance o n2 source wikipedia view the algorithm in action merge sort merge sort also commonly spelled mergesort is an efficient general purpose comparison based sorting algorithm most implementations produce a stable sort which means that the implementation

the front left of the list and the sublist of items remaining to be sorted that occupy the rest of the list initially the sorted sublist is empty and the unsorted sublist is the entire input list the algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest or largest depending on sorting order element in the unsorted sublist exchanging swapping it with the leftmost unsorted element putting it in sorted order

shell shellsort is a generalization of insertion sort that allows the exchange of items that are far apart the idea is to arrange the list of elements so that starting anywhere considering every nth

graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge uv from vertex u to vertex v u comes before v in the ordering for instance the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another in this application a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks a topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles that is if it is a directed acyclic graph dag any dag has at least one topological ordering and algorithms are known for constructing a topological ordering of any dag in linear time time complexity graphs comparing the complexity of sorting algorithms bubble sort insertion sort selection sort comparing the sorting algorithms quicksort is a very fast algorithm but can be pretty tricky to implement bubble sort is a slow algorithm but is very easy to implement to sort small sets of data bubble sort may be a better option since it can be implemented quickly but for larger datasets the speedup from quicksort might be worth the trouble implementing the algorithm search algorithms linear linear search or sequential search is a method for finding a target value within a list it sequentially checks each element of the list for the target value until a match is found or until all the elements have been searched linear search runs in at worst linear time and makes at most n comparisons where n is the length of the list properties worst case performance o n best case performance o 1 average case performance o n worst case space complexity o 1 iterative source wikipedia binary binary search also known as half interval search or logarithmic search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array it compares the target value to the middle element of the array if they are unequal the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half until it is successful properties worst case performance o log n best case performance o 1 average case performance o log n worst case space complexity o 1 source wikipedia interpolation interpolation search is an algorithm for searching for a key in an array that has been ordered by numerical values assigned to the keys key values it was first described by w w peterson in 1957 interpolation search resembles the method by which people search a telephone directory for a name the key value by which the book s entries are ordered in each step the algorithm calculates where in the remaining search space the sought item might be based on the key values at the bounds of the search space and the value of the sought key usually via a linear interpolation the key value actually found at this estimated position is then compared to the key value being sought if it is not equal then depending on the comparison the remaining search space is reduced to the part before or after the estimated position this method will only work if calculations on the size of differences between key values are sensible by comparison binary search always chooses the middle of the remaining search space discarding one half or the other depending on the comparison between the key found at the estimated position and the key sought it does not require numerical values for the keys just a total order on them the remaining search space is reduced to the part before or after the estimated position the linear search uses equality only as it compares elements one by one from the start ignoring any sorting on average the interpolation search makes about log log n comparisons if the elements are uniformly distributed where n is the number of elements to be searched in the worst case for instance where the numerical values of the keys increase exponentially it can make up to o n comparisons in interpolation sequential search interpolation is used to find an item near the one being searched for then linear search is used to find the exact item source wikipedia jump search jump search or block search refers to a search algorithm for ordered lists it works by first checking all items lkm where displaystyle k in mathbb n k in mathbb n and m is the block size until an item is found that is larger than the search key to find the exact position of the search key in the list a linear search is performed on the sublist l k 1 m km the optimal value of m is n where n is the length of the list l because both steps of the algorithm look at at most n items the algorithm runs in o n time this is better than a linear search but worse than a binary search the advantage over the latter is that a jump search only needs to jump backwards once while a binary can jump backwards up to log n times this can be important if a jumping backwards takes significantly more time than jumping forward the algorithm can be modified by performing multiple levels of jump search on the sublists before finally performing the linear search for an k level jump search the optimum block size ml for the lth level counting from 1 is n k l k the modified algorithm will perform k backward jumps and runs in o kn1 k 1 time source wikipedia quick select quick select is a selection algorithm to find the kth smallest element in an unordered list it is related to the quicksort sorting algorithm like quicksort it was developed by tony hoare and thus is also known as hoare s selection algorithm 1 like quicksort it is efficient in practice and has good average case performance but has poor worst case performance quickselect and its variants are the selection algorithms most often used in efficient real world implementations quickselect uses the same overall approach as quicksort choosing one element as a pivot and partitioning the data in two based on the pivot accordingly as less than or greater than the pivot however instead of recursing into both sides as in quicksort quickselect only recurses into one side the side with the element it is searching for this reduces the average complexity from o n log n to o n with a worst case of o n2 as with quicksort quickselect is generally implemented as an in place algorithm and beyond selecting the k th element it also partially sorts the data see selection algorithm for further discussion of the connection with sorting source wikipedia tabu tabu search uses a local or neighborhood search procedure to iteratively move from one potential solution displaystyle x x to an improved solution displaystyle x x in the neighborhood of displaystyle x x until some stopping criterion has been satisfied generally an attempt limit or a score threshold local search procedures often become stuck in poor scoring areas or areas where scores plateau in order to avoid these pitfalls and explore regions of the search space that would be left unexplored by other local search procedures tabu search carefully explores the

      "SQLFlow\n",
      "   \n",
      "What is SQLFlow?\n",
      "SQLFlow is a bridge that connects a SQL engine, e.g. MySQL, Hive, SparkSQL or SQL Server, with TensorFlow and other machine learning toolkits.  SQLFlow extends the SQL language to enable model training, prediction and inference.\n",
      "Motivation\n",
      "The current experience of development ML based applications requires a team of data engineers, data scientists, business analysts as well as a proliferation of advanced languages and programming tools like Python, SQL, SAS, SASS, Julia, R. The fragmentation of tooling and development environment brings additional difficulties in engineering to model trainning/tunning. What if we marry the most widely used data management/processing language SQL with ML/system capabilities and let engineers with SQL skills develop advanced ML based applications?\n",
      "There are already some work in progress in the industry. We can write simple machine learning prediction (or scoring) algorithms in SQL using operators like DOT_PRODUCT. However, this requires copy-n-pasting model parameters from the training program to SQL statements. In the commercial world, we see some proprietary SQL engines providing extensions to support machine learning capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Microsoft SQL Server: Microsoft SQL Server has the machine learning service that runs machine learning programs in R or Python as an external script.\n",
      "Teradata SQL for DL: Teradata also provides a RESTful service, which is callable from the extended SQL SELECT syntax.\n",
      "Google BigQuery: Google BigQuery enables machine learning in SQL by introducing the CREATE MODEL statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "None of the existing solution solves our pain point, instead we want it to be fully extensible.\n",
      "\n",
      "This solution should be compatible to many SQL engines, instead of a specific version or type.\n",
      "It should support sophisticated machine learning models, including TensorFlow for deep learning and xgboost for trees.\n",
      "We also want the flexibility to configure and run cutting-edge ML algorithms including specifying feature crosses, at least, no Python or R code embedded in the SQL statements, and fully integrated with hyperparameter estimation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quick Overview\n",
      "Here are examples for training a Tensorflow DNNClassifer model using sample data Iris.train, and running prediction using the trained model. You can see how cool it is to write some elegant ML code using SQL:\n",
      "sqlflow> SELECT *\n",

      "What is Flipt\n",
      "Flipt is an open source feature flag application that allows you to run experiments across services in your environment.\n",
      "This means that you can deploy Flipt within your existing infrastructure and not have to worry about your information being sent to a third party or the latency required to communicate across the internet.\n",
      "Flipt includes native client SDKs as well as a REST API so you can choose how to best integrate Flipt with your applications.\n",
      "Flipt Features\n",
      "Flipt enables you to add feature flag support to your existing applications, with a simple, single UI and API.\n",
      "This can range from simple on/off feature flags to more advanced use cases where you want to be able to rollout different versions of a feature to percentages of your users.\n",
      "Flipt features include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast. Written in Go. Optimized for performance\n",
      "Stand alone, easy to run server with no external dependencies\n",
      "Ability to create advanced distribution rules to target segments of users\n",
      "Native GRPC client SDKs to integrate with your applications\n",
      "Simple REST API\n",
      "Modern UI and debug console\n",
      "\n",
      "Why Flipt\n",
      "Flipt allows you to focus on building your applications without having to worry about implementing your own feature flag solution that works across your infrastructure.\n",
      "On top of this, Flipt provides a nice, modern UI so that you can always monitor the state of your feature flags and experiments in a single place.\n",
      "Running Flipt\n",
      "Flipt is a single, self contained binary that you run on your own servers or cloud infrastructure. There are a multitude of benefits to running Flipt yourself, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "🔒 Security - No data leaves your servers and you don't have to open your systems to the outside world to communicate with Flipt. It all runs within your existing infrastructure.\n",
      "🚀 Speed - Since Flipt is co-located with your existing services, you do not have to communicate across the internet to another application running on the other side of the world which can add excessive latency and slow down your applications.\n",
      "✅ Simplicity - Flipt is a single binary with no external dependencies. This means there is no database server to manage or connect to, no clusters to configure, and data backup is as simple as copying a single file.\n",
      "\n",
      "Try It\n",
      "❯ docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -p 9000:9000 markphelps/flipt:latest\n",
      "Flipt UI will now be reachable at http://localhost:8080/.\n",
      "For more permanent methods of running Flipt, see the Installation section.\n",
      "Licensing\n",
      "There are currently two types of licenses in place for Flipt:\n",
      "\n",
      "Client License\n",
      "Server License\n",
      "\n",
      "Client License\n",

      "This code exists in the rpc/ directory.\n",
      "The client code is the code that you would integrate into your applications, which is why a more permissive license is used.\n",
      "Server License\n",
      "The server code is licensed under the GPL 3.0 License.\n",
      "If there are any concerns about the use of this license for the server, please open an issue on GitHub so that we can discuss publicly.\n",
